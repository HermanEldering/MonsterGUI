# MonsterGUI

Compile it yourself, or be lazy and use the exe under bin/Release.

Basically, you run it, enter your Access Token and Room number, click Go.

Auto Clicker, Timed Lane Switcher, Respawner, Healer can be switched on and off as needed.

To find out your Access token, in Firefox open the Network inspector, click a few times on a monster, select the POST that appears, and under Params find the value for access_token.
